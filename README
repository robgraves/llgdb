LLGDB - Linked List Games Database Project 

The idea here is to create a database of board games
that I own with certain pieces of information
on each game within its own "game" struct such as
number of players or a range of players, say 1 to 4 
players included in the struct.  Additionally I will
definitely include a string or character array
including the name of the game.   The end goal being
that I can run the program and search for a random 
game for say 2 players and it will eliminate any
game that doesn't meet that criteria and randomly 
select one based on the pared down list. I'm using 
linked lists solely to exercise my ability to use them
so it will contain at least one but probably 2 pointers
in each struct and will utilize multiple list as needed.
When the program closes I plan to have it dump the database
into a file or files so as to not need to rebuild the database 
each time the program is run, then read fromt he files if 
available upon start of the program.  Additionally as a bonus
I would like to at the end add an ncurses quasi graphical
menu to the program once the base funcionality is 
written.
